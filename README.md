# ðŸš¦ CryptoLight

## Motivation

CryptoLight is a place where anyone can get a quick snapshot of the crypto market over the past 24 hours and make informed decisions. The analytics are based on calculated metrics from the Top 100 coins.

The main goal of the project is to give everyone the ability to make investment decisions without needing deep knowledge of the crypto market. That said, the app might show some metrics that only more experienced crypto investors will fully appreciate.

The app analyzes the market and shows a simple traffic lightâ€”basically answering the question: 'Is today a good day to invest in crypto?'

- ðŸ”´ - Not a good time to invest
- ðŸŸ¡ - Market is neutral: could be worth waiting, or for some, a good time to jump in
- ðŸŸ¢ - A favorable time to invest

The app is open to everyoneâ€”no sign-up required.
